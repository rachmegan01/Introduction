		<p> I started at Millersville University in January 2018 as a transfer student from Harford Community College. I will be graduating in May 2020 this year which is very exciting! Due to the way I've been playing with my credits, I am only taking this Advanced Web class and my Portfolio class. I am taking this class not only for the reason of needing it for credit, but I would really like to fully understand the coding system and allow myself to use the skills into further use. One of my passions outside of school is going to the gym! I am a early riser so I tend to hit the gym for about a hour to two hours and find it a good way to start the day and jam out to music. I love to play with my dog Toby which is basically a Chuineeie(chihuahua/dachshund). Even though he is 15 years old, he can act like a 2 year old. I have a brother and sister and my brother is already learning circuit boards at the age of 8, while my sister hits the books at the age of 9. When it comes to finding a job after graduation and preparing ahead, I am not too sure what the future holds for me, but I cannot wait to see!
